# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the homepage hero message to display the user-provided quote.

**Planned changes:**
- Replace the current hero section message text with: “I love you with all my hearts, and i am proud of you who you are!!”.
- Ensure the quote displays correctly in both light and dark mode while preserving existing hero styling (italic, centered, romantic theme).

**User-visible outcome:** The homepage hero section shows the new quote exactly as provided, with the same look and feel as before in both light and dark mode.
